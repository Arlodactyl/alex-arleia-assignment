# Clash Hub API Proxy

A simple Express server that proxies requests to the Clash Royale API using a secure `.env` key.
Use this to bypass IP whitelisting issues when developing frontend apps on school or public networks.

## How to Use
1. Add your Clash Royale API key in Railway's "Variables" as `CLASH_API_KEY`
2. Deploy from GitHub
3. Access endpoints like: `https://yourdomain.up.railway.app/player/208LUY2Q`
